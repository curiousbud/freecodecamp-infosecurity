# üõ°Ô∏è Information Security with HelmetJS

Welcome to the **Information Security with HelmetJS** repository! This project serves as a boilerplate for the information security certification from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), focusing on implementing security best practices for web applications using the powerful [HelmetJS](https://helmetjs.github.io/) middleware.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate key concepts and practices of **information security** through the integration of **HelmetJS**. By completing this project, you will gain knowledge necessary to achieve the **FreeCodeCamp Information Security Certification**.

## üîë Features

- Secure your Express applications by setting HTTP headers with HelmetJS
- Implement protection against common web vulnerabilities:
  - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
  - **Clickjacking**
  - **MIME Sniffing**
- Learn how to configure and customize various HelmetJS middleware modules

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher recommended)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curiousbud/freecodecamp-infosecurity.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd freecodecamp-infosecurity
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Using HelmetJS for Security

HelmetJS helps to secure your Express applications by configuring HTTP headers. This project includes the following HelmetJS middleware:

- **helmet.frameguard()**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by setting the `X-Frame-Options` header.
- **helmet.xssFilter()**: Mitigates XSS attacks by setting the `X-XSS-Protection` header.
- **helmet.noSniff()**: Protects against MIME sniffing by setting the `X-Content-Type-Options` header.
- **helmet.hidePoweredBy()**: Removes the `X-Powered-By` header to make it harder for attackers to identify the server technology.
